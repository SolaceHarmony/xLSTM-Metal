Validate presence and placement of upstream xLSTM files and Metal kernel scaffolding.

This does not import modules; it only inspects the workspace to:
- Confirm upstream-like files exist in xlstm_official (or xlstm_official_full subset)
- Confirm our implementation locations exist
- Confirm Metal kernels and bindings exist and are discoverable

Exit code 0 on success; non-zero if critical files are missing.
Prints a human-readable report to stdout.

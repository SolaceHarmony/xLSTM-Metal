# build

Build helpers and integration scripts related to low-level kernels or environment tooling.

**PYTHON NOTE (READ ME FIRST): python3 is trash - it's the MacOS python which I can't upgrade. python is the 3.12 version from conda.**

Contents
- `build_metal_extension.py` (if present): example or legacy helper; current inference path uses compiled MPS, not handwritten Metal.

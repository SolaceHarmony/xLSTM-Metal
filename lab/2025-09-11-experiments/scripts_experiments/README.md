# experiments

Scratchpad and experimental utilities not part of the core runtime.

**PYTHON NOTE (READ ME FIRST): python3 is trash - it's the MacOS python which I can't upgrade. python is the 3.12 version from conda.**

Contents
- `slstm_stability_quest.py`: stability probes for sLSTM/mLSTM dynamics.

Note
- Experiments should avoid importing from `scripts/runners` to keep core paths clean.

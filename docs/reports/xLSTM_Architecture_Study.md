## 2. mLSTM (Matrix LSTM) Block

### 2.1 Architecture Overview

The mLSTM block is the primary building block, using **matrix-valued hidden states** instead of vectors. This enables a covariance update rule and dramatically increases memory capacity.

### 2.2 Mathematical Formulation

#### Input Projections

Given input `x ∈ ℝ^(B×S×D)` where B=batch, S=sequence, D=embedding_dim:

```
Query:    q = W_q · x     ∈ ℝ^(B×S×H×d_k)
Key:      k = W_k · x     ∈ ℝ^(B×S×H×d_k)  
Value:    v = W_v · x     ∈ ℝ^(B×S×H×d_v)
Output:   o_pre = W_o · x ∈ ℝ^(B×S×D)
```

Where:
- H = num_heads
- d_k = qk_dim_factor × embedding_dim / num_heads
- d_v = v_dim_factor × embedding_dim / num_heads

#### Gate Computations with Soft Capping

```python
# Input gate (per head)
i_preact = W_i · x + b_i                    # ∈ ℝ^(B×S×H)
i_preact = soft_cap(i_preact, cap=15.0)

# Forget gate (per head)
f_preact = W_f · x + b_f                    # ∈ ℝ^(B×S×H)
f_preact = soft_cap(f_preact, cap=15.0)

# Output gate (per sequence position)
o = sigmoid(o_pre)                          # ∈ ℝ^(B×S×D)
```

#### Soft Capping Function

The soft cap prevents numerical instability:

```python
def soft_cap(x, cap):
    return cap * tanh(x / cap)
```

#### Exponential Gating with Stabilization

The key innovation is exponential gating with proper stabilization:

```
# Stabilizer update (prevents overflow)
m_t = max(f_preact + m_{t-1}, i_preact)

# Stabilized exponential gates
i_t = exp(i_preact - m_t)
f_t = exp(f_preact + m_{t-1} - m_t)
```

#### Matrix Memory Update (Covariance Rule)

The memory is updated using a covariance-like rule:

```
# Matrix memory update
C_t = f_t ⊙ C_{t-1} + i_t ⊙ (v_t ⊗ k_t^T)

# Normalizer update  
n_t = f_t ⊙ n_{t-1} + i_t ⊙ k_t

# Hidden state computation
h_t = (C_t · q_t) / max(n_t^T · q_t, 1)
```

Where:
- C_t ∈ ℝ^(B×H×d_v×d_k) is the matrix memory
- n_t ∈ ℝ^(B×H×d_k) is the normalizer
- m_t ∈ ℝ^(B×H) is the stabilizer
- ⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication
- ⊗ denotes outer product

### 2.3 Complete mLSTM Block

```python
class mLSTMBlock:
    def forward(x, state):
        # 1. Pre-normalization
        x_norm = RMSNorm(x)
        
        # 2. mLSTM layer
        h, new_state = mLSTMLayer(x_norm, state)
        
        # 3. Skip connection
        x = x + h
        
        # 4. Feed-forward network with normalization
        x_norm = RMSNorm(x)
        ff_out = FeedForward(x_norm)
        
        # 5. Second skip connection
        x = x + ff_out
        
        return x, new_state
```

## 3. sLSTM (Scalar LSTM) Block

### 3.1 Architecture Overview

The sLSTM enhances traditional LSTM with exponential gating while maintaining scalar hidden states. It's more memory-efficient than mLSTM but with less capacity.

### 3.2 Mathematical Formulation

#### State Updates

Given states (h, c, n, m) and input x:

```python
# Gate computations
i_raw = W_i @ x + R_i @ h + b_i
f_raw = W_f @ x + R_f @ h + b_f
z_raw = W_z @ x + R_z @ h + b_z
o_raw = W_o @ x + R_o @ h + b_o

# Exponential gating with log-space stabilization
log_f_plus_m = m + logsigmoid(f_raw)
m_new = max(i_raw, log_f_plus_m)

# Stabilized gates
i_gate = exp(i_raw - m_new)
f_gate = exp(log_f_plus_m - m_new)
o_gate = sigmoid(o_raw)

# State updates
c_new = f_gate * c + i_gate * tanh(z_raw)
n_new = f_gate * n + i_gate
h_new = o_gate * (c_new / n_new)
```

Key differences from vanilla LSTM:
1. Exponential gates (i_gate, f_gate) instead of sigmoid
2. Normalizer state `n` for numerical stability
3. Stabilizer state `m` to prevent overflow

---

## 4. Feed-Forward Network

### 4.1 Architecture

The FFN uses a gated linear unit (GLU) variant:

```python
class FeedForward:
    def forward(x):
        # Dimension expansion
        up_dim = round_up(embedding_dim * 2.6667, 64)
        
        # Gated projection
        gate = Linear(x, up_dim)
        up = Linear(x, up_dim)
        
        # Activation and gating
        hidden = silu(gate) * up
        
        # Dimension reduction
        output = Linear(hidden, embedding_dim)
        
        return output
```

### 4.2 SiLU Activation

The Sigmoid Linear Unit (SiLU/Swish) activation:

```
silu(x) = x * sigmoid(x)
```

---

## 5. Normalization Layers

### 5.1 RMSNorm (Root Mean Square Normalization)

Used throughout the architecture for its efficiency:

```python
def RMSNorm(x, weight, eps=1e-6):
    # Compute RMS
    rms = sqrt(mean(x^2) + eps)
    
    # Normalize and scale
    return weight * (x / rms)
```

### 5.2 MultiHeadLayerNorm

Applied after mLSTM computation:

```python
def MultiHeadLayerNorm(x, num_heads, head_dim):
    # x shape: [B, S, H, D/H]
    
    # Normalize per head
    for h in range(num_heads):
        x[:, :, h, :] = LayerNorm(x[:, :, h, :])
    
    return x
```

# xLSTM Implementation Report

Update — 2025-08-28 (Apple/MPS backends)
- Inference uses compiled MPS kernels:
  - Step: `metal` (PyTorch `torch.compile` on MPS with stabilized float32 math)
  - Sequence: `native_sequence__metal`
  - Prefill (chunkwise): `queued_compiled_steps`, `ray_compiled_steps`, or `native_compiled_autograd`
- Unique chunking approach: heads split into bands; sequences split into small chunks (default 32). A thread pool or Ray actors enqueue many small compiled step kernels; all math runs on GPU; per‑band sequential order preserved. Tunables: `chunk_size`, `heads_per_band`, `workers`, `streams`.
- Entrypoint: `scripts/run_local_xlstm_mps.py` with CLI flags and env‑var mapping. See also `docs/TUNING_GUIDE.md`.

### Optimization Harness
- Automated sweeps via `scripts/optimize_mps.py` (random or GA) write logs to `runs/mps_opt/<backend_ts_tag>/` with `run_meta.json`, `trials.jsonl`, `summary.csv`, `best.json`.
- Output regeneration and scoring: `scripts/save_outputs_for_trials.py` and `scripts/judge_outputs.py` compute quality (avg_logprob, perplexity) and diversity (distinct‑2/3).

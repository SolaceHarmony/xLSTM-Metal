# MLX vs Ray (Coordinator) for xLSTM on Apple

This document contrasts the MLX path and the Ray‑coordinated PyTorch MPS path. Both execute core math on Apple GPUs; they differ in orchestration, streams, and tooling.

## Summary Table

| Aspect | MLX Path | Ray + PyTorch MPS Path |
|---|---|---|
| Execution | Single process; MLX ops on GPU | PyTorch `torch.compile` on MPS; Ray actors (or queued) schedule prefill |
| Concurrency | Explicit streams; `mx.stream(...)` | Actor/task concurrency; optional CPU thread pool |
| Orchestration | Minimal; DIY callbacks & logs | Dashboard, metrics, cluster‑ready orchestration |
| Kernels | Optional Metal kernels via `mx.fast.metal_kernel` | Compiled PyTorch graph on MPS; no handwritten Metal |
| Memory | Unified; minimal host barriers | Unified; Ray adds process boundaries when not in local_mode |
| Tuning | Tile sizes, stream boundaries, fast head | `chunk_size`, `heads_per_band`, `workers`, Ray local_mode |
| Best for | Lean single‑machine inference; kernel experiments | Managed coordination; observability; complex pipelines |

## When to Choose Which

- Choose MLX when:
  - You want a minimal, fast inner loop on Apple GPUs.
  - You plan to experiment with Metal kernels or stream overlap.
  - You don’t need a dashboard or multi‑actor orchestration.
- Choose Ray + PyTorch MPS when:
  - You need coordination, dashboards, retries, distributed patterns.
  - You prefer compiled PyTorch graphs over custom kernels.
  - You want identical metrics and tooling across multiple backends.

## Interop Ideas

- Use Ray as a coordinator around an MLX core if you need lifecycle + metrics, with MLX doing device work inside actors.
- Use MLX Data streams for input pipelines and leave orchestration to Ray.
- Keep stream waits stream‑scoped even in Ray actors (avoid global barriers).

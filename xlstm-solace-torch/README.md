xlstm-solace-torch — import xlstm_solace_torch

Purpose
- PyPI-ready packaging for the PyTorch path (MPS + Ray), import name `xlstm_solace_torch`.

Disclaimer
- Independent Solace fork; not affiliated with NX‑AI or the original xLSTM authors.
- Name intentionally includes “solace” to avoid confusion with upstream.

Status
- Pre-release scaffolding. CLI wiring and module exports will be added after the src/ refactor.

Notes
- Target Python: 3.12 (conda base recommended).
- Focus: PyTorch on Apple Silicon (MPS) with Ray for chunkwise orchestration.
